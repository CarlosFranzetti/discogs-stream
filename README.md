## 🌟 Recent Updates (Feb 2026)

🛡️ **Failsafe Audio Chain** - YouTube searches now always run through yt-dlp → Invidious → YouTube API, even after quota is exceeded. No more dead silence!
💾 **Cloud Persistence on Import** - CSV imports now write resolved YouTube IDs and cover art straight to the database. Reopen the app and everything is there instantly
🔀 **Sequential Shuffle** - Shuffle OFF now sorts your playlist by artist → album → track position. Toggle ON to randomize, toggle back OFF to restore the ordered view
🔎 **Playlist Search** - New search bar at the top of the playlist panel lets you filter your queue live by title or artist
🔁 **Smart Dimmed Tracks** - Tracks without a stream are dimmed (not removed). First tap triggers a silent background retry; second tap plays if it resolved. Background verifier also retries `non_working` tracks automatically over time
📱 **Cleaner Title Screen** - The "Connect via CSV files below or sign in" card is gone. Just upload your CSV and hit Start Listening
🎯 **Track Sync on Start** - If audio is already preloading when you tap Start Listening, the displayed track now correctly matches what's actually playing
⚙️ **Discogs OAuth in Settings** - Discogs account connection moved to the Settings panel (gear icon) with a clear experimental warning
